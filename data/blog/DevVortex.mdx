# Hack The Box Write-Up: DevVortex 

#### Enumeration 
Launching a scan against our target machine :

```
./scan.sh 10.10.11.242
[+] open ports are '22,80' 
Starting Nmap 7.93 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2023-12-13 07:48 EST
Nmap scan report for devvortex.htb (10.10.11.242)
Host is up (0.15s latency).

PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 8.2p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.9 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
80/tcp open  http    nginx 1.18.0 (Ubuntu)
Service Info: OS: Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel

Service detection performed. Please report any incorrect results at https://nmap.org/submit/ .
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 8.15 seconds

```

As Mentioned above, open ports are 80(HTTP service),22(SSH service).Let's visit the website.

It was a dummy website and even the  Contact Us and Email Subscription forms almost  do nothing because  the  `action` attribute of the form is empty (`action=""`) which means that the data will be submitted to the same URL that rendered the form which is a HTML page(can’t handle data passed in the URL).

#### Subdomains Enumeration
 Starting a Sub-domain enumeration with `ffuf`  was fruitful as it reveals the `dev.devvortex.htb` subdomain .

I added to vhost to  `/etc/hosts` and I visited the website.

Another Dummy website!!!!!!!
#### Directory enumeration
I got he idea to run a directory enumeration .

Visting  the /robots.txt: 

```
# If the Joomla site is installed within a folder
# eg www.example.com/joomla/ then the robots.txt file
# MUST be moved to the site root
# eg www.example.com/robots.txt
# AND the joomla folder name MUST be prefixed to all of the
# paths.
# eg the Disallow rule for the /administrator/ folder MUST
# be changed to read
# Disallow: /joomla/administrator/

Visiting /administrator :

Our application hosted by the **Joomla** CMS. We have  a login page. My initial thought was to determine the version of Joomla being used. I found a Metasploit Module that can scan the joomla version for me. 

```
auxiliary/scanner/http/joomla_version
```
running it reveals that the used version is : `4.2.6`

![joomlascan.png](/static/images/joomlascan.png)
Some searches reveal that this version contains an improper API access vulnerability as shown below.  

![ba3bas](/static/images/ba3bas.png)
used another metasploit module to exploit this  vulnerability.
![joomla_api_exploit.png](/static/images/joomla_api_exploit.png)

Running the module and it reveals some credentials. 
![Untitled design (2).png](/static/images/Untitled design (2).png)
I attempted to authenticate on the Joomla login page using previously found credentials.
![jmal.png](/static/images/jmal.png)

Now,it would be great if  I can  establish a reverse shell to our host machine.
navigating through System -> Templates ->site templates ,I found an installed PHP template (error.php) that I can edit and  use it to my advantage to gain a reverse shell.

I pasted my reverse shell :
![php.png](/static/images/php.png)

I started a listener on the `1234` port. and I visited the template to trigger the execution of my reverse shell paylaod.

```
curl http://dev.devvortex.htb/templates/cassiopeia/error.php
```
![rev.png](/static/images/rev.png)

listing the home directory there was another user (logan).I got the idea to connect to the joomla  database and see if there is any important informations.
![database.png](/static/images/database.png)
As expected ,the password of the `logan` user is here but hashed. That's why we need to crack  using john . 
![hash_carck.png](/static/images/hash_carck.png)


I used  logan  credentials and attempted to  authenticate via SSH .
![ssh.png](/static/images/ssh.png)

#### Privilege Escalation

running `sudo -l` to know which commands `logan` is   allowed to run with elevated privileges using `sudo`.
![sudo.png](/static/images/sudo.png)

Logan can run  the apport-cli utility with root access.
doing some researches reveal that a privilege escalation attack was found in apport-cli 2.26.0 and earlier (for more details you can visit :[[https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-1326]]).
I Found A  POC of this CVE in github [[https://github.com/diego-tella/CVE-2023-1326-PoC]] that helped me to exploit this vulnerability and  get the root access.
